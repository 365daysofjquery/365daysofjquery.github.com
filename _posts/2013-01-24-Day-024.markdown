In [Day 021](/Day-021), you used an `integer` to select a specific `li`.

With an `integer` it's possible to use 'Arithmetic Operators'.

	var addition = 5 + 5;
	$('span.addition').text(addition);


In the above code, you set a `variable` (I'll cover this in more depth in a further day).

The `variable` will be equal to the result of the 5 + 5. You then call jQuery, look for a `.span` element in the DOM with a class of `addition`. Then use the `.text` method to add the variable answer to that element.

Similarly it's possible to do subtraction, multiplication and division.
