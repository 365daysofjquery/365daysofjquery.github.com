Sorry for the lack of updates recently.

This has been due to two things, firstly I've not been well and secondly at [@edgeconf](http://twitter.com/edgeconf) I was chatting to [@rem](http://twitter.com/rem) regarding his thoughts on 365 Days of jQuery.

Remy mentioned it's a long time to devote solely to one JavaScript library. He suggested calling it '365 Days of Anything'. Being somewhat of a web hero of mine I'm inclined to agree with him.

It's my intention to keep 365 Days of jQuery going, but to concentrate on other areas as well, I'm currently looking at starting up an event [#McrFRED](http://www.simonowendesign.co.uk/manchester-front-end-web-development-meetup/) and hope to have more information on this soon.

As always, any contributions and pull requests via GitHub would be great.
