As well as the [Arithmetic Operator](/Day-024) '+' it's also possible to use as a string operator to concatenate strings together.

Inspecting the code for various demos, you'll see code such as:

	'true && true' + ' = ' + and1 + '<br/>'


In this instance, the result concatenates the strings, so everything wrapped in `''` will be output, notice that `and1` isn't wrapped in `''` therefore it's not a string, in this case it will return the value of the variable.

Inspect this [demo](/Demo-031) for [Day-031](/Day-031) for a closer look.
