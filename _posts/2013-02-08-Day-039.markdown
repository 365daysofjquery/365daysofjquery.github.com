In [Day 012](/Day-012), we used `.css` to manipulate elements when the page loads, in order to have the changes made when a user clicks an element, it's possible to use `.click`.

`.click` is triggered when the mouse button is depressed and then released whilst inside the element.

Here's an example, in our HTML if we have:

	<div class="clickMe">Click me to make me red!</div>

Then with jQuery we add:

	$('div.clickMe').click(function(){
		$('div.clickMe').css('color','red');
	});

Check out the [Demo](/Demo-039) to see it in action.
