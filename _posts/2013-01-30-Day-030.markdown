Here's a simple arithmetic expression:

	2 + 3 = 5


In this instance `2` is one of the inputs (quantities), this is an `operand`.

The `+` is an addition `operator`, followed by another `operand` 3.

The `operand`, `operator` and final `operand` make up an `operation`.

The result, also known as sum or value of the `operation` is 5.
