In [Day 039](/Day-039), we learnt about `.click` and how it's possible to change CSS once. If you'd like to toggle an effect we can use `.toggleClass`. Rather than in the previous demo where we added the CSS within the JavaScript, this time we'll toggle a class and then apply those styles using CSS. It's usually best practice to use this method as it helps to keep the code maintainable.

Here's an example, in our CSS we have:

	.clickMe {
		cursor: pointer;
	}
	.on {
		color: red;
	}


In our HTML we have:

	<div class="clickMe">Click me to toggle!</div>


Then with jQuery we add:

	$('div.clickMe').click(function(){
		$('div.clickMe').toggleClass('on');
	});

Check out the [Demo](/Demo-040) to see it in action.
