As well as standard addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there's also a few others that are a bit more complicated.

`%` known as 'modulus', will return the value remainder as an integer of the diving two operands.

Eh!? You what?

Yeah :p

Let's look at a few examples, it's actually a lot easier than it sounds.

	14 % 5 = 4
	20 % 5 = 0
	200 % 5 = 0


5, goes into 10 two times, with a remainder of 4.

5, goes into 20 four times, with a remainder of 0.

5, goes into 200 forty times, with a remainder of 0.
