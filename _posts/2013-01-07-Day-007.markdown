Ok, so now you've gone over some of the basics, let's get a bit of code working.

Copy the following code or view the [demo](/demos/Day-007.html):

	<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Console Log</title>
	</head>

	<body>

	<button>Button</button>

	<!-- jQuery -->
	<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"><\/script>')</script>

	<script>

		$('button').click(function(){
			console.log('button is clicked');
		});

	</script>

	</body>
	</html>


Paste this code into a new file, save this somewhere and open in Google Chrome.
If you don't already have Google Chrome you can download it [here](http://www.google.com/chrome).

In Google Chrome you want to view the `console`. This can be found in Google Chrome's Developer Tools `View > Developer > Developer Tools` or use the shortcut `alt + cmd + i`.

By default the Elements tab is selected, select the `console` tab. Now click the `button` that's in the browser window, you should now see the text `button is clicked` appear in the `console`. Awesome. This will come in very handy in future posts to work out what jQuery is outputting.

The `console` and Google Chrome Dev Tools is where I spend a vast amount of time whilst developing, it's also possible to theme. I use <https://github.com/simonowendesign/SO-Dark-Monokai-v3>. Still needs some work, but it's getting there.
