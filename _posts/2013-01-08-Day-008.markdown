Whilst writing and viewing code you'll be using at least a browser and most likely a text editor.
You'll also need a way to open and navigate the files you're working on.

Here's some tools you may find useful to help.


## Quicksilver

<http://qsapp.com/> allows you to bring up a small popup and start typing to find things you most often use.

## Spectacle

<http://spectacleapp.com/> is a real time saver, forget moving your mouse to the bottom of a window to re-size it. Setup some shortcuts and automate window re-sizing with shortcuts. Great for quickly moving your browser to the left and your text editor to the right of the screen. Here's the shortcuts I use:

## LiveReload

<http://livereload.com/> again is a great time saver, when editing code in your text editor then saving, it will automatically reload your browser for you with the changes made.
