In previous days you've added some text to a h1.

	$('h1').text('here is some text');


You've also added HTML content to the body.

	$('body').html('<h1>Here Is Some HTML</h1>);


This is great, but what if things are a little more complicated? You've got two `ul`, but you only want to manipulate one of the lists.

Take a look at this code.

	$('ul.one').children('li').css('color', 'blue');


This will search for a `ul` which has a class of `one`, then any `li` that are direct children, will have the CSS value changed to blue.

For a closer look, you can open up this [demo](/demos/Day-018.html) and inspect the code.
