In [Day 018](/Day-018), you looked at how to select children, but what if you wanted to select all specific elements?

In this instance the `.find` method comes in handy.

Take this example:

	$('ul.three').find('li').css('color', 'fuchsia');


Here, you'll call jQuery, search for a `ul` with a class of `three`, then find all the `li` elements and apply a CSS colour value.

If you take a look at this [demo](/demos/Day-020.html).
Using the `children` method, CSS only gets applied to the children.
Using `find`, the CSS gets applied to all the `li`.

Hoorar!
