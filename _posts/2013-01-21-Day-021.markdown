JavaScript is a 'zero based language'.

This means that if you have 5 elements, JavaScript counts them as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, if you wanted to select the first `li` in a `ul` you could do the following:

	$('ul li').eq(0).css('color', 'red');


This will search for the first `li` and apply a CSS colour value of red.

To select 'four' you'd do:

	$('ul li').eq(3).css('color', 'green');


Notice here, you don't wrap the number in `'`.

This is something that can take a while to get to grips with. In this instance the number added to the `.eq` method is an `integer`. Rather than passing a `selector` as a `string` that jQuery can search the DOM for, here the `.eq` method requires an integer as a 'plain Number type'. More about [numbers and strings in Day 027](/Day-027).
