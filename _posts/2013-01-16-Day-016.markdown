Notice in the [previous day](/Day-015) we wrapped the text we wanted to display in `'`, but what if you need to use `'` to be displayed in your text?

This code won't work:

	$('h1').text('here's some text');


Because the jQuery will look for the first `'` to start and `'` to end, viewing this code in the console you'll get:

	Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier


To rectify this and display the `'` as text you can add `\` before like so:

	$('h1').text('here\'s some text');
