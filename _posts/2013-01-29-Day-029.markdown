Simply put a `boolean` returns either a `true` or `false` value.

You'll find it very handy if you want to action code dependent on whether a value is `true` or `false`.

For example if you had a site where users could log in, you could write some conditional code to check if the user was logged in.

If the statement came back `true` you could display their name, if it came back `false`, you could prompt them to log in or sign up.
