This example shows how you can take advantage of using CSS3 selectors.

	$('ul li:first-child').css('color', 'crimson');


Although it's possible to do this in JavaScript using:

	$('ul li:first').css('color', 'crimson');


This will be slower, however it will also work in older browsers such as IE6 if this is a requirement.
