`camelCase` is a consistent naming convention used throughout jQuery.

Starting with a lowercase letter and adding a capital to each word thereafter makes things a lot easier to read.

Here's some examples without camel case:

*   getsetattribute
*   inlineblockneedslayout
*   shrinkwrapblocks
*   setattributenode
*   scrollleft


Now again with camel case:

*   getSetAttribute
*   inlineBlockNeedsLayout
*   shrinkWrapBlocks
*   setAttributeNode
*   scrollLeft

Much easier to read :D
