Arrays look a bit like this:

	var myArray = ['Array element one', 'Array element two', 'Array element three'];

They are zero-indexed, meaning that in this case `Array element one` = `0`.

In the [Demo](/Demo-036), if you inspect the console it's possible to call the array using:

	console.log(myArray[0]);
