As well as ['Arithmetic Operators'](/Day-024), there's 'Comparison Operators'.

As the name suggests, these are used to make comparisons.

Here's some examples:

	'Equal' ==

	'Not Equal' !=

	'Strict Equal' ===

	'Strict Not Equal' !==

	'Greater Than' >

	'Greater Than or Equal' >=

	'Less Than' <

	'Less Than or Equal' <=

This [demo](/Demo-028) shows them in action.

Pay careful attention to the difference between using 'Strict'.

	1 == '1' true
	1 === '1' false

Here `==` using a number and a string will return `true` whilst using `===` will return false.
