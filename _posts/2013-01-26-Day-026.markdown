You can also increment and decrement values.

You can use either of these as a prefix or postfix operator.

	var i = 10;

	var a = ++i;
	var b = i++;
	var c = --i;
	var d = i--;


Increment prefix:	`a` would be equal to `11` and `i` equal to `11`.

Increment postfix:	`b` would be equal to `11` and `i` equal to `12`.

Decrement prefix:	`c` would be equal to `9` and `i` equal to `9`.

Decrement postfix:	`d` would be equal to `9` and `i` equal to `8`.
