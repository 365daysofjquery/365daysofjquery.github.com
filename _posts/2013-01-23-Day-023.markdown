Here you'll learn how it's possible to use `.next` and `.prev` to select elements.

Take the following example:

	$('ul li:first-child').next().css('color', 'crimson');


Here you look for the first `li` element then using the `.next` method, select the next element.

Similarly, it's possible to use `.prev` to select the previous element.

Take a look at this [demo](/Demo-023) and inspect the elements for a closer look.
