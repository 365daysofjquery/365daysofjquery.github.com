As mentioned previously if you open up the [development version of jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js) and search for `:` plus what you're looking for, in this case `noConflict:`, you'll see:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4462005.js"></script>

It's also worth noting the jQuery API site has just had a sweet update and searching for noConflict, you'll find:
<http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/>

There's a few times, especially in WordPress builds where I've seen people fix multiple JavaScript libraries by constantly defining jQuery:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4467382.js"></script>

This can be improved using the following code to set `$` back as an alias `jQuery`.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4467391.js"></script>

Another alternative that's worth mentioning is using the following code which is essentially doing the same job.
It is less descriptive, so not that great if you're a beginner trying to figure what is going on, but when you do, it's less code and widely used.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4468045.js"></script>
