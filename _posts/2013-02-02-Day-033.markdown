In the [previous day](/Day-032) you looked at how it's possible to concatenate strings, but what if you want a string to work as a number?

	5 + '5'


Will give you the number 5, then concatenate 5, giving you 55.

	5 + Number('5')


In this case the string will be converted to a number, giving you 10.

It's also possible to do the same thing using the 'Unary Plus Operator' like so:

	5 + +'5'


Although `+'5'` is less code, you might want to use `Number('5')` if you're still new to the 'Unary Plus Operator' as it's more descriptive.

[Demo](/Demo-033).

Hey... wouldn't it be awesome if there was some sort of site that would all you to work out the performance between using the `number` and `operator` methods and anything JavaScript related for that matter... Head on over to [Day-34](/Day-034).
